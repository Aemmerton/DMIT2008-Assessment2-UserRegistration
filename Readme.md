# Assessment-2

### What This Project Does
- This project allows a user to register an account which is validated on the client side
- If the user inputs invalid data, error messages will be displayed
- After the account is validated/registered a user object matching it is added to the users.json file
- If the user successfully registers, they are routed to the login page
- When logging in the email and password are validated against the user objects within the     users.json file
- If the login validation is confirmed the user is routed to the dashboard
- If the login validation isn't correct the user is presented with errors and stays on the login page
